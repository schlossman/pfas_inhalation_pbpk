```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Including Math

In R Markdown you can use LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions inline $y=x_1+2*x_2$ or centered 
$$z = \int_0^1 3x \, dx$$

## Including Code

You can also include code that you want to display to the reader:
 
```{r}
x <- seq(0,10,by=0.1)
y <- 2*x+1
z <- 0.5*(x-5)^2+5
```

The code is also run, so the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ now exist and are assigned variables in this environment. 

### Including Plots

Or you can supress the call of the code and just display the outputs:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(x,y,type = "l", col="red")
lines(x,z, col = "blue")
```
